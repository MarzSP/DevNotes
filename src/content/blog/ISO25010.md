The **ISO/IEC 25010** standard defines how we talk about *software quality*. Instead of treating “quality” as a fuzzy idea, it breaks it into **eight characteristics** that can be measured and designed for.

### The Eight Characteristics

1. **Functional Suitability**  
   Does the software do what it’s supposed to? Are all required functions present, correct, and complete?

2. **Performance Efficiency**  
   How fast and resource-friendly is it? This covers response time, throughput, and memory/CPU usage.

3. **Compatibility**  
   Can the system work well with other systems? Does it run on different platforms or integrate smoothly with external services?

4. **Usability**  
   Is it easy for people to learn and use? Includes accessibility, consistency, and user satisfaction.

5. **Reliability**  
   How stable is it over time? Can it recover from crashes or keep running under stress?

6. **Security**  
   Does it protect data and resist attacks? Think authentication, authorization, encryption, and auditing.

7. **Maintainability**  
   How easy is it to change? Covers modularity, readability, testability, and how simple it is to fix bugs or add features.

8. **Portability**  
   Can it be deployed in different environments? From operating systems to cloud vs. on-premise.

### Why It Matters

ISO 25010 gives software teams a **shared language**. Instead of saying *“make it better”*, stakeholders can be precise:
- “We need **performance efficiency** under weak networks.”
- “Accessibility falls under **usability**.”
- “We must guarantee **reliability** for 24/7 uptime.”

By mapping goals to these categories, architects and developers can design systems that meet real expectations—not just technical guesses.
