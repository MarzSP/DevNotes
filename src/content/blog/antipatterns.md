Patterns are proven solutions. **Antipatterns** are their evil twins: recurring *bad* solutions that look tempting but cause pain in the *** later. Here are some of the most common ones:

### Ivory Tower
The architect designs in isolation, far away from the realities of coding or user needs. Decisions are made on paper (or in fancy tools), but the development team can’t relate — or worse, ignores them. The result? A beautiful plan nobody follows.

### Gold Plating
Features or components are “perfected” beyond what the user asked for. Developers keep polishing, adding details, or refactoring, even when it adds no business value. Time and money disappear into a system that’s elegant but doesn’t solve the right problems.

### Overengineering
Building an architecture that’s way more complex than needed: multiple abstraction layers, premature scaling strategies, or frameworks for problems that don’t exist yet. It looks impressive, but slows down development and makes the system harder to change.

### Golden Hammer
The “one tool for everything” syndrome. Teams force a familiar technology into every use case (“we’ll just use our database as a message queue too!”). Comfort wins over fit, and the system suffers for it.

### Why antipatterns matter
Antipatterns often start with good intentions: quick delivery, reuse, future-proofing. But without balance, they create fragile, hard-to-maintain systems. Spotting them early — and calling them out — is part of every architect’s job.
