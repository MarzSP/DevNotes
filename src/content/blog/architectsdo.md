The job title *software architect* sounds fancy, but what do architects actually **do** day-to-day? 

According to thinkers like Philippe Kruchten and Rozanski & Woods, the role is a cocktail of technical design, communication, and decision-making. Here are the main responsibilities:

### 1. Define the architecture
Capture the system’s high-level structure: modules, layers, interactions, and technologies. This is where architects decide *how* requirements will be realized in software form.

### 2. Identify architecturally significant requirements (ASRs)
Not all requirements are equal. Performance, scalability, security, maintainability, and usability goals often drive architecture more than functional “features.”

### 3. Make and document key decisions
Architecture is a series of trade-offs. Architects choose frameworks, patterns, integration styles, and infrastructure — and document why, so the reasoning isn’t lost.

### 4. Create architectural views and models
Different stakeholders need different perspectives. For example:
- **Logical view** → developers
- **Process view** → operations
- **Deployment view** → infrastructure teams  
  These views make the architecture understandable and actionable.

### 5. Evaluate and validate the design
Check whether the architecture meets quality goals. This can include reviews, prototypes, performance testing, or applying checklists.

### 6. Communicate and collaborate
Perhaps the most underrated role. Architects act as translators between business stakeholders, developers, and operations. They ensure alignment across all groups.

### 7. Govern and guide implementation
Architects  guide developers, ensure consistency, and revisit decisions when reality changes.

### 8. Manage evolution
Software never stands still. Architects keep the system adaptable, handling new requirements, scaling needs, and technology shifts without losing control.
