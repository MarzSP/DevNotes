Software architecture patterns give structure to complex systems. Here are the **core ones** you’ll hear about most often:

### 1. Layered (N-Tier)
Probably the most common. Code is split into layers (presentation, business logic, data). Easy to understand and maintain, but can get rigid as systems grow.

### 2. Client–Server
A clear split between a **server** that provides services and **clients** that consume them. Think web apps: browser  < >️ backend.

### 3. Microservices
Instead of one big application, the system is broken into many small, independently deployable services. Offers flexibility and scalability, but adds complexity in communication and monitoring.

### 4. Event-Driven
Components communicate through events (messages). Decoupled and scalable, but requires strong attention to consistency and debugging.

### 5. Pipe-and-Filter
Data flows through a sequence of processing steps (filters). Great for stream processing, compilers, or image pipelines.

### 6. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
An older cousin of microservices. Systems are built from reusable services, often communicating via enterprise buses. Still relevant in big organizations.

### Why patterns matter
Architecture patterns are tried and tested blueprints. They give teams a shared vocabulary and help avoid reinventing the wheel. Most real-world systems combine multiple patterns (for example, a layered microservice that’s event-driven inside).
