I read If It’s Smart, It’s Vulnerable in 2024, and it left me with an ever so slightly light tingle of paranoia. Like a low steady hum in the back of my mind. That feeling then sticks around while you’re setting up a new device, like a printer or a robot vacuumcleaner, or installing an app, or writing a bit of code that.. “probably won’t be a problem”. This book has taught me to not accept the thought of “probably” anymore.

Mikko Hyppönen is a legendary figure in the security world. He’s been around since the early days of computer viruses and has seen the landscape evolve over decades. In this book, he distills that experience into a series of essays that explore how our increasing reliance on “smart” technology opens us up to new vulnerabilities.

Hyppönen has a way of throwing you head first into rabbit-holes without making you feel lost. He glides from real-deal hacks to bigger ideas about trust, complexity, and how we keep building systems faster than we can truly understand them. There’s no fear-mongering involved, just a calm, almost casual reminder that once something becomes “smart”, it also becomes vulnerable in ways we didn’t design for.

The book is easy to read without feeling shallow. It doesn’t drown you in jargon, but it also doesn’t hold your hand. You walk away with a real sense of why things fail, not just a list of horror stories. Some of the ideas lingered with me for a long time afterwards — especially how convenience quietly etches away at security. It’s the kind of thing that creeps into your thinking while you’re coding, making you pause while coding and think, “Okay, but what assumptions am I actually making here?”

I had the pleasure of seeing — and briefly meeting — Hyppönen in 2026, and it only deepened the impression the book had already left on me. The same clarity, the same grounded use of real-world examples, and the same humble way of raising awareness about the tech we rely on and what's going on in the world. He has a down-to-earth way of explaining complex realities. It’s the kind of perspective that sticks with you, nudging you to think more critically, write better code, and develop a deeper understanding of the technological world you’re helping to build.
