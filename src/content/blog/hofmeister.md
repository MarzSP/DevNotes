## The Hofmeister Method
I see software architecture a bit like playing 4D-chess. You have to think several moves ahead, anticipate challenges, and adapt to changing requirements. 

It's 80% arguing about boxes and arrows and 20% actual architecture. However it's those very boxes and arrows help us visualize and communicate our architectural decisions effectively.

### Who's this Hofmeister?
Christine Hofmeister, Robert Nord, and Dilip Soni worked at Siemens and wrote the book Applied Software Architecture (1999). They basically asked:

`“What if we designed software the way engineers design bridges — with actual process, not just vibes?”`

The Hofmeister Method was born: a cycle of analysis → synthesis → evaluation, sprinkled with four architectural views. It’s battle-tested in large industrial projects where "move fast and break things" would actually literally break things.

### The three steps
Think of architecture design as a never-ending loop of “oh no” moments:

_Analyze_

Gather all the requirements, constraints, and context.

Quality attributes 
Find the architectural drivers: the non-negotiables 


_Synthesize_

Here’s the genuinely fun part! Turn requirements into design.

Partition the system into components.

Pick architectural styles (layers, pub/sub, microservices)

Define interfaces


_Evaluate_

Test your architecture before it tests you.

Quality Attribute Scenarios (“what if 5,000 inspectors open the map at once on 4G?”).

Prototypes

Reviews (a.k.a. politely tearing your design apart in a meeting).

Then repeat until deadlines eat you alive.


### The four views
Hofmeister et al. suggest documenting your architecture from four perspectives:
1. **Module View**: How the code is organized into modules, packages, or libraries. This is the view developers care about most.
2. **Conceptual View**: The high-level structure of the system, including major components and their interactions. This is the view for stakeholders and architects.
3. **Execution View**: How the system behaves at runtime, including processes, threads and communication patterns.
4. **Code View**: The actual source code structure, including files, directories, and build systems.
