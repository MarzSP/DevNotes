		Hey there! <br>
		I’m a third-year Software Engineering student and currently working as a
		Full-Stack Developer. I built <strong>DevNotes</strong> as my public learning log: a place to
		summarize what I study, the concepts I’m practicing, and the things I learn in real projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		This blog is part study guide, part field notes — written to be useful for other students,
		junior devs, or anyone curious about how we turn theory into working code.
