			<h1>🧑‍🚀 Hello world!</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to the DevNotes blog.
				I’m a software engineering student documenting what I learn in short, practical notes you can skim fast.
				Think summaries, “ah-ha” moments, patterns, and concrete examples — all in one place.
			</p>

			<p>
				Many posts focus on programming language features and core concepts,
				with code examples written in JavaScript, Java, and C# —
				simply the languages I work with most.
			</p>

			<p>
				Posts explain what a feature <em>is</em>;
				and show how it <em>behaves</em> through real code.
				The goal is to understand what’s happening under the hood, so you (and I) can write better code.
